# flaffr-web
Flaffr.com web client made by _Michał Prusak_ and _Szymon Woźniak_.

### How to build
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
The build output will be saved to the `build/` directory as `flaffr-bundled.js`.

### Documentation
We do not have any documentation for the app, because writing such would be pointless.
Instead, we have written a small reference for the Flaffr API, which can be found under the `docs/` directory.
